# Data Sructure

- Data Structure ia a systematic way to organize data in a order to use it efficiently.

## Arrays

Arrays stores a same-kind elements collection that may be identified by an index or key. Some programming languages allow different kinds of elements in an array, but most don't.

## Stack

A Stack is an ordered items collection based on the L.I.F.O principle, Last In - First Out, where a new element is always added on the top of the stack, and the elements are also removed from the top to the bottom of the stack. A great example is a plate stack, where the dirty plates are added to the top and the top plate is the first to be dished.

## Queues

A Queue is an ordered items collection based on the F.I.F.O principle, First In - First Out, otherwise the Stack, a new element is added in the end of the queue, called tail, and removed from the start, called head. An exemple is a bank queue.

## Hash Table

Hash tables are data structures that combines a table with a hash function.
Your function is to particionate a dataset to make the searching easier, faster, and more efficient.
The hash function is used to associate each key to a table position.
